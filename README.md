### Hello there, I'm Devorah Ortega
#### I am a front-end web developer.

Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a creative eye and a knack for technical challenges. I recently completed my bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Science at Hebrew Theological College and a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development from Actualize and I'm looking to put the skills I learned to use.

My favorite part about writing code is exercising my creative muscle and learning to communicate with my computer, and I get to do that each day as I learn and practice the skills I have learned in database development and website creation. When Iâ€™m not at my computer or googling answers to my many questions, Iâ€™m reading, writing fantasy, or hiking in the mountains. I never pass up an opportunity to talk history or Star Wars, and Iâ€™m passionate about all things fantasy.

Skills: RUBY / RAILS / VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
