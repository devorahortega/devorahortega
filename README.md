Hello There! I'm Devorah Nina Aberman (Ortega)

Front-End Developer | Creative Thinker | Code Enthusiast

I'm a front-end developer with a passion for crafting intuitive, beautiful, and functional user experiences. I love the blend of creativity and logic that coding brings, it’s like having a conversation with a computer where the dialogue is built with design, data, and clean syntax.

My favorite part of development is the creative process: transforming complex problems into clear, user-friendly solutions. Whether I'm designing a responsive interface, optimizing performance, or fine-tuning database interactions, I bring curiosity, empathy, and persistence to every challenge.

What I'm All About
- Blending aesthetics with functionality
- Solving technical puzzles with thoughtful design
- Always learning — especially through collaboration and community
- Exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas

I’ve been growing my skills in database development, front-end architecture, and web application design, and I'm excited to keep leveling up.

Languages & Frameworks:
JavaScript | Ruby on Rails | Python | Vue.js | HTML | CSS

Databases:
PostgreSQL

Other Tools:
Git | GitHub | VSCode | Figma | REST APIs | Responsive Design Principles

When I’m not deep in dev mode, you’ll probably find me:
- Rolling dice in a game of D&D
- Getting lost in fantasy novels
- Exploring trails or collecting rocks on a hike

These hobbies inspire my work and keep my creativity fueled.

If you're working on something interesting, want to collaborate, or just want to talk tech and TTRPGs, feel free to reach out!
