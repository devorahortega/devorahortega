### Hello there, I'm Devorah Ortega
#### I am a front-end web developer.

Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a creative eye and a knack for technical challenges. My favorite part about writing code is exercising my creative muscle and learning to communicate with my computer, and I get to do that each day as I learn and practice the skills I have learned in database development and website creation. 

Hobbies:

Skills: RUBY / RAILS / VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
