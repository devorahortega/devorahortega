Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a creative eye and a knack for technical challenges. My favorite part about writing code is exercising my creative muscle and learning to communicate with my computer, and I get to do that each day as I learn and practice the skills I have learned in database development and website creation. I am passionate about my work and learning new things from new perspectives.

Hobbies: D&D, fantasy books, hiking, scrapbooking, rock collecting, problem solving 

Skills: RUBY / RAILS / VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
